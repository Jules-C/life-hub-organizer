# Technology Stack & Budget Analysis

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS + HeadlessUI
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **API Client**: Axios
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive design with optional PWA capabilities
- **Deployment**: Netlify or Vercel (both offer generous free tiers)

### Backend
- **API Framework**: Node.js with Express or Fastify
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth or Firebase Authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (built on S3)
- **Deployment**: Railway.app or Render.com

### Document Processing
- **OCR**: Tesseract.js (client-side) or minimal usage of OCR Space API
- **Parsing**: pdf.js for PDF extraction
- **Metadata Extraction**: Custom extractors for common document types

### Integration Components
- **Email Integration**: Gmail API with OAuth 2.0
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar API + Microsoft Graph API
- **Notification System**: Email + Browser push notifications
- **Automation**: Pipedream.com for workflow automation (replaces n8n)

## Monthly Budget Analysis

| Service | Purpose | Free Tier | Paid Tier | Est. Monthly Cost |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Supabase | Database + Auth + Storage | 500MB database, 1GB file storage | $10/project | $10 |
| Netlify/Vercel | Frontend hosting | 100GB bandwidth, unlimited sites | Free | $0 |
| Railway.app | Backend hosting | $5 credit/month | $5+ | $5 |
| Pipedream | Automation workflows | Core workflows free | $19/month | $0-19 |
| OCR Space | Document OCR | 500 req/day limit (25,000/month) | Free | $0 |
| DNS/Domain | Custom domain | - | $1-2/month | $2 |
| **TOTAL** | | | | **$17-36** |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Storage Optimization**
   - Implement document compression
   - Use thumbnail generation for previews
   - Set up lifecycle policies to archive older documents

2. **Compute Optimization**
   - Use serverless functions where possible
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Schedule background jobs during off-peak hours

3. **Integration Optimization**
   - Batch API requests to external services
   - Cache calendar data locally
   - Minimize webhook frequency for non-critical updates

4. **Budget Expansion Options**
   - Add OCR.space paid tier ($29/month) only if document volume increases significantly
   - Upgrade database resources only when performance becomes an issue
   - Consider self-hosting components on a VPS if costs approach $40 threshold

## Key Dependencies and Alternatives

| Component | Primary Choice | Alternative Option | Trade-offs |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL | PlanetScale MySQL | MySQL vs PostgreSQL, pricing structure |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | Firebase Auth | Integration complexity, feature set |
| Storage | Supabase Storage | Cloudinary | Cloudinary has media optimization but higher costs |
| Hosting | Railway.app | Fly.io | Different pricing models, geographical distribution |
| Automation | Pipedream | n8n self-hosted | Managed service vs maintenance overhead |

## Scalability Considerations

The proposed architecture can comfortably handle:
- 10-50 documents per week
- 5-10 family members
- Several years of document history

As your needs grow, the most likely scaling points will be:
1. Storage requirements (especially for high-resolution document scans)
2. OCR processing if document volume increases substantially
3. Database performance if you store many years of historical data

The system is designed to allow component upgrades without major rearchitecting.
