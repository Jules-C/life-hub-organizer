## Critical Path Dependencies

1. Authentication system must be complete before implementing document storage
2. Document storage must be functional before calendar and email integration
3. Basic document and calendar features must be complete before dashboard creation
4. All core components must be functional before implementing automation workflows

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. Begin OAuth integration early to address potential API approval delays
2. Implement progressive enhancement to ensure basic functionality works without advanced features
3. Design modular components that can be developed in parallel by decoupling dependencies
4. Create fallback plans for each integration in case of API limitations or changes
