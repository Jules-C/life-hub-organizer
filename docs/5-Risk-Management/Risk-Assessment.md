## Technical Privacy Controls

1. **Row-Level Security**:
   - Database-enforced access controls
   - User-specific filtering of sensitive data
   - Family-aware permission system

2. **Encryption Strategy**:
   - At-rest encryption for all database data
   - Enhanced encryption for health-related tables
   - Encrypted backups with separate key management

3. **Authentication Enhancement**:
   - Multi-factor authentication option for health data access
   - Session timeout controls for sensitive features
   - Login notification for privacy-critical account changes

4. **Anonymization Options**:
   - Data export with anonymization capabilities
